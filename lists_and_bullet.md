# Lists and bullet points

To create lists, start the line with asterisks or minus symbol.

* item 1
- item 2
* item 3

Can only ever use bullet points, no other types e.g. dashes for lists.


-----
Can make sub-lists with two spaces before the asterisk for an item.

* item 1
  * item 1a
  * item 1b
  
  
-----
Can create numbered lists by typing the number with a period.
Note that the numbers don't even need to be continuous, GitHub will automatically do this.

1. item 1
2. item 2
1. item 3
